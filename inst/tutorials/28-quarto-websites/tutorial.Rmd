<!-- Current time is 90 minutes, which is too long. So, let's split into 2: Quarto Websites Introduction and Quarto Websites Advanced. The first does everything up to Adding new pages. The second does two things. First, show how to split stuff up, with RDS and PNG files. Second, it covers some more advanced topics, perhaps to include Github pages. -->

<!-- Windows seems to make the creation of websites more difficult than it is on the Mac, especially with commands like quarto publish. See: https://discord.com/channels/1066524559240597595/1066524726278762608/1252099440496476190 and the following discussion for an example. -->

<!-- Too much text per question. Split it up into more questions with shorter knowledge drops. -->

<!-- The quarto_publish_site() function from the quarto R package does not currently work with Quarto Pub. Since this is the only free (and easy to use) site for publishing websites, we have no choice but to run Quarto CLI, at least for publishing. Given that fact, it is easiest to use CLI for the whole tutorial. This might be worth re-visiting with after quarto 1.5 comes out. -->


## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers material from [Chapter 28 Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) and [Chapter 29 Quarto formats](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats.html) in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, although much of the information from Chapter 28 has already appeared in the "RStudio and Github" tutorial in this package. We will go into much more detail with regard to the creation and organization of [Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) using the [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (command line interface) and commands like `quarto create project`, `quarto render`, `quarto preview` and `quarto publish`.




## Creating files
### 

Let's make a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

### Exercise 1

Run `quarto --version` from the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r creating-files-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

My answer:

```
Davids-MBP:r4ds.tutorials dkane$ quarto --version
bash: quarto: command not found
```

If it works for you, don't worry.

This failure is somewhat surprising since RStudio comes bundled with a version of Quarto, but that version is tucked away in a hard-to-use location, usually (on a Mac) something like:

```
/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto
```

<!-- DK: Awkward: Perhaps run library(quarto) first to ensure that it is there.  -->

You can see the location on your machine by running `quarto::quarto_path()` at the R Console. Instead of installing a second version of Quarto --- and having to deal with all the weird problems which can arise from that --- we might just add this location to our PATH. But that can be tricky, so we just install another version of Quarto which will appear on the PATH by default.


### Exercise 2

If `quarto --version` failed in the previous Exercise, install [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on your computer. Then, run `quarto --version` again from the Terminal. CP/CR. (You may need to restart RStudio after installing Quarto.)

```{r creating-files-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

My answer:

```
Davids-MBP:r4ds.tutorials dkane$ quarto --version
1.4.554
Davids-MBP:r4ds.tutorials dkane$ 
```

As long as the version is at least 1.4, you are OK. Again, having Quarto installed in two separate locations is a bit hacky, especially if they are different versions. But this seems a better approach then messing with your PATH.

### Exercise 3

Create a public Github repo (called "first-website"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box. Copy/paste the URL for its Github location.

```{r creating-files-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
https://github.com/davidkane9/first-website
```

Always start a new data science project with a new Github repo.


### Exercise 4

Connect the `first-website` Github repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `first-website` also. Keeping the names of repos/projects aligned makes organization simpler.

You will need to "Terminate Jobs" this tutorial. And you will be placed into the new project after RStudio restarts, as usual. Just restart the tutorial after this happens.

From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r creating-files-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

```
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ ls
README.md               first-website.Rproj
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
```

The default README has an "md" suffix to indicate that it is a **M**ark**d**own document.


### Exercise 5

In the Terminal, run `quarto create project website .`.  Don't forget the `.` at the end of the command. This indicates that the new files should be placed in the current working directory. 

<!-- DK: Should make this more clear, even screen shots. -->

Depending on your computer setup, this command will generate require you to answer some questions. Do so as best you can. If given a choice, choose "rstudio" rather than "vscode." 

This command will usually result in a restart of your RStudio instance. Or it might create a second R instance, also located in the `first-website` directory. If so, close one of the instances. It does not matter which.

<!-- DK: The above is hacky! Is there a better approach? -->

CP/CR.

```{r creating-files-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MacBook-Pro:first-website dkane$ quarto create project website .
Creating project at /Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/first-website:
  - Created _quarto.yml
  - Created .gitignore
  - Created index.qmd
  - Created about.qmd
  - Created styles.css
Davids-MacBook-Pro:first-website dkane$ 
````

Quarto is telling you what it did: creating 5 new files and placing them in the *current* directory. Recall that, on the command line, a `.` refers to the current directory. 

### Exercise 6

In the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r creating-files-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files()
[1] "_quarto.yml"         "about.qmd"           "first-website.Rproj" "index.qmd"          
[5] "README.md"           "styles.css"         
````

The basic set of files necessary for making a Quarto website has been added to the current directory. Note how we can work with the current directory either from the Terminal, with commands like `ls`, or from the Console, with commands like `list.files()`. It is important for you to be comfortable with both approaches, so we intermix them in this tutorial.


### Exercise 7

In the Console, run `list.files(all.files = TRUE)`. CP/CR. 

```{r creating-files-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
> list.files(all.files = TRUE)
 [1] "_quarto.yml"         "."                   ".."                  ".git"               
 [5] ".gitignore"          ".Rhistory"           ".Rproj.user"         "about.qmd"          
 [9] "first-website.Rproj" "index.qmd"           "README.md"           "styles.css"         
> 
```

### 

You would get the same set of files if, in the Terminal, you ran `ls -a`. The `-a` ensures that **a**ll the files are listed, included the "hidden" ones which begin with a dot. Recall that `..` means the directory one level above the current one.

### 

In general, we do not touch/manipulate "dot" directories, meaning directories whose names begin with a dot or period. Such directories are meant to be used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the program Git uses the `.git` directory to store information about changes in all the files in the project. 


## Examining files
### 

Now that we have created the necessary files, it is useful to examine them one-by-one. The goal is to provide you with a good introductory lesson about how websites are put together.

### Exercise 1

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

Did you get an error when you ran this? Something about 'could not find function "show_file"'? This is because you need to `library(tutorial.helpers)` to have direct acccess to `show_file()`, which is a function in the **tutorial.helpers** package. Of course, you could use the double colon notation --- `tutorial.helpers::show_file("_quarto.yml")` --- as we did in previous tutorials. But, at this stage in your R education, we want/hope you to be getting more comfortable with packages, and knowing yourself when they need to be loaded.


```{r examining-files-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

YAML files are how [Quarto projects](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html) tell the world what they are. You can tell that `_quarto.yml` is a YAML file by both its `yml` filename suffix and by its content. The initial lines specify that this is a website.

````
project:                                   
  type: website
````

But other values for `type` are possible.

### Exercise 2

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 4, end = 10)
````

CP/CR.

```{r examining-files-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

These lines provide meta-information about the website and its organization. 

````
website:
  title: "."
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
````

Indents and other whitespace matter in the interpretation of a YAML file.

### Exercise 3

In the Source pane, open the `_quarto.yml` file. Replace `title: "."` with `title: "A New Website"`. Save the file. The indentation before `title` should be the same extent as before `navbar` below it.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 4, end = 10)
````

CP/CR.


```{r examining-files-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

With luck, future versions of `quarto create project` will use a `dir` argument to specify the location of the new files, thereby allowing the `name` argument to be used for a sensible title for a newly-created project. In the meantime, we need to set our title by hand.

### Exercise 4

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 12, end = 16)
````

CP/CR.

```{r examining-files-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

These lines provide formatting information about the pages of the website. 

````
format:                                       
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
````

The `css` line tells Quarto to use the `styles.css` file, located in the same directory, for the "style" of the pages.

### Exercise 5

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.


```{r examining-files-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like:

````
> show_file("index.qmd")
---                               
title: "."
---

This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.
> 
````

Whenever a web browser goes to a directory on the internet, it looks for an `index.html` file. If found, that file is displayed. So, the `index.qmd` file, which we will soon render as `index.html`, is important.

### Exercise 6

Open the `index.qmd` file in the Source pane. Replace `title: "."` with `title: "My First Website"`. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.


```{r examining-files-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Yes, it is a bother to have to replace `"."` twice. Very annoying! With luck, Quarto will soon allow us to specify a title when we first create these files. In the meantime, it is good to have an occasion to look closely at the files which help us to create a website.

### 

Note that the `title` (`"A New Website"`) in `_quarto.yml` has no necessary connection to the `title` (`"My First Website"`) in `index.qmd`. The former is the title for the entire website. The latter is the title for just the (yet-to-be-created) `index.html` page.

### Exercise 7

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.


```{r examining-files-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

```
> show_file(".gitignore")
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata

/.quarto/
> 
```

Note that `.gitignore` contains a new line: `/.quarto/`. This was added when we ran `quarto create project`.  The leading `/` escapes the `.`. In other words, we need the leading `/` if we want to ignore the files in a dotted directory.

In fact, the `.quarto` directory does not yet exist. But the `quarto create project` command wanted to ensure that, once it does, Git would ignore it and its contents.


### Exercise 8

We don't want to put all the files on Github. So, add `*Rproj` to the `.gitignore` file. Save the file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r examining-files-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### 

Good data scientists believe in transparency and reproducibility. We want people --- include "future" us --- to be able to reproduce our work. By default, almost every file belongs on Github. But settings for R projects are both not necessary for replication and often specific to each individual. 


### Exercise 9

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r examining-files-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The output from the `git log` command is too complex for us to fully parse. If you want to learn more about how to work with Git/Github and R, check out [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html), a very useful resource.


## Rendering and previewing
### 

We now have the infrastructure for our website. We want to create (or "render") the webpages themselves and then "preview" them to see what they will look like when we place them on the web.


### Exercise 1

From the Terminal, run `quarto render`. CP/CR.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto render
[1/2] index.qmd
[2/2] about.qmd

Output created: _site/index.html

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

Quarto reports to us what it has done, working on our two `qmd` files and creating a new directory, `_site`, in which it has placed an `index.html` file. 



### 

If you look at the `_site` directory in the Files tab, you will see lots of new files, including `about.hmtl`. Quarto just tells you about the home page for the site, which is `index.html` by default, since that is the file that browsers like Google Chrome always look for.


### Exercise 2

From the Console, run `list.files("_site")`. CP/CR.


```{r rendering-and-previewing-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer will probably look something like:

````
> list.files("_site")
[1] "about.html"  "index.html"  "search.json" "site_libs"   "styles.css" 
>
````

The `about.html` and `index.html` files are simply the rendered `about.qmd` and `index.qmd` input files. They are placed into the `_site` directory because the convention, when constructing websites and other large projects, is to separate out the outputs from the inputs.

### 

The webpages which make up a website are often placed in a directory named either `_site` or `docs`, depending on the setup of your web hosting service.

We won't discuss the `search.json` and `styles.css` files. The `site_libs` directory includes many files beyond the scope of this tutorial. The basic idea is that the entire `_site` directory is a functioning website, ready to be deployed.

### Exercise 3

Add `/_site` to the `.gitignore`. Don't forget that the last line of a `.gitignore` should always be blank. Save the file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This command is [convenient](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) because the `_site` directory contains of lot of weird files that change often enough to annoy. We don't create any of them directly, so we don't really need to back them up. Moreover, they will still get published directly to the web from our computer.

### 

The initial backslash in `/_site` allows Git to interpret `_site` correctly. The `/` escapes the `_`, allowing it to be treated as a literal, rather than special, character. See the "Regular expressions" tutorial in this package for more information. `_site` is a directory, so we could end the expression with a backslash, but Git, like most programs interpret `_site` and `_site/` to refer to the same thing, which they do.


### Exercise 4

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. CP/CR.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto preview
Preparing to preview
[1/1] index.qmd

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:7412/
GET: /
````

The `quarto preview` command does two things. First, it renders the `qmd` files, just like `quarto render` does. Second, it sets up a viewer --- probably your default web browser but possibly the "Viewer" tab in the Output pane  --- so that you can see what the website looks like. Click around and check it out!

The message at the end indicates that Quarto is now "watching" your files to see if you make any changes. If you do, it will automatically update the website.

### Exercise 5

Look at your website in the browser. (You might need to enter the URL by hand. It is `http://localhost:7412/` in my case, but yours will be different.) Click on the "About" link. 

Now, go to the Terminal. Copy-and-paste everything from the previous invocation of `quarto preview`.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto preview
Preparing to preview

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:7193/
GET: /
GET: /about.html
````

Quarto is hanging out, still running in the background, monitoring your website. So, when you clicked the "About" link, it went to "GET" the `about.html` page to show to you.


### Exercise 6

Look again at your website in the browser. Click on the "Home" link and then copy/paste the entire screen.


```{r rendering-and-previewing-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
A New Website


My First Website
This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.
````

The title of the entire project ("A New Website"), taken from the `_quarto.yml` file, appears in the upper left hand corner. The title of the main home page ("My First Website"), taken from the `index.qmd` file, appears at the top of the Home page, which, by default, is always the `index.html` file. 

(Depending on your browser and other settings, the copy/paste might also capture the "Home" and "About" links. No worry either way.)


### Exercise 7

Copy/paste the URL for your previewed website.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should be something like:

````
http://localhost:7193/
````

The website is being "hosted" on your computer. That is what the word "localhost" refers to. It is not available on the web.


### Exercise 8

The advantage of using `quarto preview` is that the website is automatically updated whenever you edit and save the underlying QMD file. Try it by changing the `about.qmd` file, replacing "About this site" with your name. Save the file. 

At the Terminal, you should see a new message. Copy and paste it here.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

````
pandoc 
  to: html
  output-file: about.html
  standalone: true
  title-prefix: A New Website
  section-divs: true
  html-math-method: mathjax
  wrap: none
  default-image-extension: png
  css:
    - styles.css
  toc: true
  
metadata
  document-css: false
  link-citations: true
  date-format: long
  lang: en
  theme: cosmo
  title: About
  
GET: /about.html

````

Quarto has noticed that you changed/saved the `about.qmd` file. It rendered the new version, creating a new `about.html` which it has now *gotten* and is displaying.

### Exercise 9

Copy/paste the About page from the Viewer pane or your browser. (We will just say "browser" going forward, but we mean wherever your website appears.)

```{r rendering-and-previewing-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this, except with your name instead of mine!

````
A New Website

About
David Kane
````

If you want to stop `quarto preview` you can cancel the command by hitting the red stop sign which is located in the upper right of the Terminal pane. (If the red stop sign is not visible, you can also stop `quarto preview` by typing `Ctrl + c`.)

## Publishing
### 

To make your website publicly visible, you need to "publish" it to the web. The Quarto documentation provides a [thorough discussion](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/).

### Exercise 1

If you don't already have one, set up a [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) account for hosting the website. 

* In your browser, type `quartopub.com`, it will take you directly to the website

* Click the big blue button that says **Sign Up**. 

* We recommend using your Github username and password. (It is much easier this way, so you don't have to juggle around a bunch of passwords and usernames when you want to publish.)

Copy/paste the web address of your Quarto Pub account. Your answer should look like this:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub
````


```{r publishing-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Beyond [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html), there are other free services which you can use to host your website and other data science projects, examples include [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) and [Posit Cloud](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/posit-cloud.html).


### Exercise 2

Ensure that all the files in the project have been committed and pushed. (Recall that you have, at least, edited `about.qmd` and that doing so has caused changes in other downstream files.)

At the Terminal, type: 

`quarto publish quarto-pub` 

You will then need to hit the "Enter" button twice, accepting the default options for account (your email address) and site name ("a-new-website"). CP/CR.


```{r publishing-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto publish quarto-pub
? Publish with account: â€º dave.kane@gmail.com
? Site name: â€º a-new-website

[âœ“] Creating quarto-pub site

Rendering for publish:

[2/2] about.qmd

[âœ“] Preparing to publish site
[âœ“] Uploading files (complete)
[âœ“] Deploying published site
[âœ“] Published site: https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website
[âœ“] Account site updated: https://davidkane.quarto.pub

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

`quarto publish`, like `quarto preview`, first renders all the files on the project. Note the phrase "Rendering for publish" in the output. You are provided with the URL for the new site, `https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website` in this case, and the URL for the main account site, which is `https://davidkane.quarto.pub` for me.

### Exercise 3

A link to your new website should be brought up in a browser. Copy/paste the URL for your website. 

```{r publishing-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

It should look like:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website/
````

Note that, in addition to this website for public viewing, there is a corresponding site from which you can change various Quarto Pub options, as well as just delete the entire site. That location for me is:

````
https://quartopub.com/sites/ce7610ad-76d9-4356-a2cb-586d31992254
````

It will be somewhere different, but equally weird, for you. You can access this site by logging in to Quarto Pub.

The **quarto** package, which we have not installed, provides R commands for accomplishing these same goals. We do not use it in this tutorial.


### Exercise 4

Check your Git tab. Assuming you committed everything before running `quarto publish quarto-pub`, as instructed, it should be easy to notice the new files. Write down the name of the new YAML file, the file with `.yml` at the end.


```{r publishing-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `_publish.yml` is where Quarto keeps track of publishing information. This file did not exist before because you had not published the website yet. 

There *might* also be some new files, like `_site/robots.txt` and `_site/sitemap.xml`, but, as usual, we won't worry too much about weird files in the `_site` directory since we added `/_site` to `.gitignore`.

### Exercise 5

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_publish.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r publishing-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
> show_file("_publish.yml")
- source: project                                                
  quarto-pub:
    - id: cfb2577e-312e-4717-892a-42b92619ebe3
      url: 'https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website'
>
````

In general, we will not edit the `_publish.yml` file directly. 

### Exercise 6

If you look closely, you will see a new directory, `.quarto`, in the Files tab. Neither this directory, nor any of the files within it, appear in the Git tab because of the `/.quarto/` line in the `.gitignore` file.

From the Console, run `list.files(".quarto")`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `.quarto` directory is like the `.git` and `.Rproj.user` directories. We will never look at or change the files inside of them. Only the relevant programs --- Quarto, Git and RStudio --- should work with the contents of these directories. 


### Exercise 7

Open the `_quarto.yml` file in the Source pane. Change `title: "A New Website"` to `title: "A New Website, second edition"`. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 4, end = 5)
````

CP/CR.


```{r publishing-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 4, end = 5)
website:                                 
  title: "A New Website, second edition"
>
````

Keep track of the three different places that the title of our project now exists. First, it is present in `_quarto.yml`. We have changed it there. But we have not changed it in the `_site` files which constitute the website nor in files uploaded to Quarto Pub.


### Exercise 8

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. Copy and paste the text from the home page once it comes up on your browser.

```{r publishing-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
A New Website, second edition

Home
About
My First Website
This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.
````

But, if you look at the Quarto Pub version of your website, it still uses the "A New Website" title because we have not (yet) published our new version. We have, however, changed the files in the `_site` directory.

### Exercise 9

Stop the `quarto preview` command by hitting the red stop sign on the upper right of the Terminal tab. From the Terminal, run `quarto publish`. CP/CR.

You only need `quarto publish`, instead of `quarto publish quarto-pub` because the `_publish.yml` records that this project is published on Quarto Pub. You are simply refreshing the current project, rather than creating another.


```{r publishing-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto publish
? Publish update to: â€º https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website (Quarto Pub - dave.kane@gmail.com)
Rendering for publish:

[âœ“] Preparing to publish site

[âœ“] Published site: https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website
[âœ“] Account site updated: https://davidkane.quarto.pub

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

Note that, even though we have changed the `title` in the `_quarto.yml` file, this change has not affected the URL for the project, which still ends with `a-new-website`. Quarto Pub will select the title of the project as the URL "slug" when the project is first created, but it won't change that URL even if you change the title of the project.


### Exercise 10

Add `_publish.yml` to the `.gitignore` file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r publishing-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `_publish.yml` file is like the `first-website.Rproj` file. In *theory*, they might contain private information of some sort, like logins or passwords, and so do not belong on Github. But, in reality, [they rarely](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html#publish-command) do. Still, we like you to practice the editing of configuration files like `.gitignore`.

### Exercise 11

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log -n 2` in the Terminal. CP/CR. 

The `-n 2` option causes Git to just provide the information on the last two commits.

```{r publishing-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Note both the simplicity *and* the complexity of your project. It is simple in that, even if our computer blew up we would be able to recreate everything from the files on Github. It is complex in that there are a lot of files, interacting in a fairly sophisticated fashion.

Sam Csik provides an [excellent overview](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) of the entire process of creating Quarto websites. Note her use of Github Pages instead of Quarto Pub.

## Adding a plot
### 

Let's add a visualization for your website by modifying `index.qmd`. Recall that this file will always create our "home" page because it is rendered to `index.html`. Browsers, by default, show `index.html`, if one exists, when they visit a new directory. 

### 

We are going to add the following plot to your website's home page.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
```

### 

<!-- DK: Not sure if this step is really necessary, but it is not bad to get students used to closing RStudio and then opening on old project. Indeed, we ought to make them practice such skills! -->

First, however, you should restart RStudio, not just the current R instance. The reason for this is that we want to ensure a clean environment after our prior usage of various Quarto commands. After your restart RStudio, make sure you are within the `first-website` R project. (If, on restart, you are not automagically placed in `first-website`, you can [switch to this project via the project dropdown menu](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/projects.html#opening-projects) in the far upper right-hand corner of RStudio.)

### Exercise 1

Delete everything in `index.qmd` except for the `title: "My First Website"` surrounded by the three dashes, above and below. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

(Did you remember to `library(tutorial.helpers)` first? Without this, R can't find he `show_file()` command.)

```{r adding-a-plot-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The material bracketed by the three dashes at the very top is called a **YAML Header**. These are very sensitive about all sorts of subtle formatting issues. 


### Exercise 2

Create a new code chunk in `index.qmd` and load the **tidyverse** package. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", chunk = "Last")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

There are actually three ways to do most things associated with project/website creation.

First, we can use RStudio. This is our preferred approach, since it is the easiest for beginning students. Unfortunately, the RStudio interface is somewhat behind in using Quarto effectively.

Second, we can use an R package like **quarto** directly. RStudio buttons are, generally, connected to R package commands. 

Third, we can work with Quarto directly at the Terminal. This is often referred to as *working from the command line*. R packages often call Terminal commands behind the scenes. [Current limitations](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r/issues/101#issuecomment-2093088356) of the **quarto** package force us to use this option.



### Exercise 3

Render the document by pressing the "Render" button at the top of the Source pane. You will probably be sent to a local preview of the new homepage. 

Click on the "Background Jobs" tab in the Console pane. Copy-and paste the text which appears there.
 

```{r adding-a-plot-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
==> quarto preview index.qmd --to html --no-watch-inputs --no-browse

processing file: index.qmd

Output created: _site/index.html

Terminating existing preview server....DONE

Preparing to preview

Watching files for changes

GET: /index.html
````

In other words, RStudio figures that, if you are rendering an `index.qmd` which is part of a Quarto website project, you probably want to preview your new homepage. So, it calls `quarto preview` behind the scenes. The "Background Jobs" tab is where RStudio reports to you what is happening in the background.

<!-- This page probably appeared in your Viewer tab in the Output pane even though `quarto render` generally  -->


### Exercise 4

In other words, you might not have to run `quarto preview` from the Terminal. Just rendering `index.qmd` directly is often enough. Copy and paste the new home page, leaving out the menu items.

```{r adding-a-plot-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 10)
```

### 

You answer should look like this:

````

````

Because we have not yet added any code chunk options, the code is echoed and the package startup message displayed.


### Exercise 5

Create another code chunk. Add this code to it:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

Save the file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", chunk = "Last")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

`Command/Ctrl + Shift + K`. You will see a nice plot, along with a lot of junk code and messages. Note that RStudio might only redirect you to the plot the first time you render `index.qmd`. Going forward, you may need to affirmatively click on the correct tab on your browser or on the Viewer tab in the Output pane to see the newly rendered page.


### Exercise 6

Add these code chunk options to the top of the first code chunk, the one which loads the library.

<!-- DK: These reason these aren't in a four backticks area is because format_tutorial() would, for unknown reasons, add a space between # and | if we did that, and such a space makes these no longer function as chunk options when pastes into the students' index.qmd. Without the blanks lines, these are all placed in the same paragraph. -->

`#| message: false`

`#| echo: false`

`#| label: setup`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", pattern = "#")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Code that works during your R session will not work when your website is rendered if you have not loaded the required libraries into the document. But our readers don't want to see that code, much less the messages which it produces. So, we hide them.

You are generally free to label your chunks however you like, but there is one chunk name that imbues special behavior in RStudio: `setup`. When you first open a Quarto document, the chunk named `setup`, if there is one, will be run automatically once, before any other code is run.


### Exercise 7

In the second code chunk, add the following options:

<!-- DK: See above comment. Really need to fix format_tutorial so that, first step, it totally ignores anything within four backticks. But, I suspect the real problem is in parsermd. -->

`#| echo: false`

`#| label: diamonds-plot`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", pattern = "#")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Assigning labels to code chunks helps keeps you organized and helps others understand your code. You cannot assign the same label to multiple code chunks. 

Your chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (`-`) to separate words (instead of underscores, `_`) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels.

### Exercise 8

Render the `index.qmd` with the "Render" button. It should show the plot. As always, you should render with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + K`. Shortcut keys are lit!

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 12)
```

### 

There are two common modes for working with larger projects. First, as here, we work with an individual file, like `index.qmd`, and ensure that it is working as we want. Second, as before, we work with the project as a whole, using commands like `quarto render`, which render all the files in the project. The former approach is quickest and is how we spend most of our time. But, at the end of the day, we need to build the entire project.

### Exercise 9

It is annoying to use the same code chunk option in every code chunk. In `index.qmd`, both code chunks contain `#| echo: false`. Delete both of them. Edit the YAML header so that it includes:

````
execute: 
  echo: false
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", end = 5)
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> show_file("index.qmd", end = 5)
---
title: "My First Website"
execute: 
  echo: false
---
````

If you added `echo: false` as an `execute` argument in `_quarto.yml`, this would affect all the QMD files in the entire project. In other words, you can set an option like `echo` in three places: individual code chunk, entire QMD file, or entire project. Options set at higher levels can be overruled by changing the setting at a lower level.


### Exercise 10

Go to the Git tab. Commit and push your new changes to Github. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added plot to home page".

In the Terminal, run `quarto publish`. You don't need to include `quarto-pub` since that information now appears in the `_publish.yml` file. You will need to hit "Enter" once.

It will not bring you to your website, but to your Quarto Pub account, where you will see the website address. Click on it and copy and paste the URL below:

```{r adding-a-plot-10}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website/
````

Keep track of the three different versions of the website. 

First, we have the QMD files in the project directory which are used to create the website. This is the original source, the place where changes should be made. 

Second, we have the rendered version of the files which reside in the `_site` directory on our computer. We do not edit these files directly, but we do look at them when we are "previewing" the website.

Third, we have the website itself, the files which other people can see. These reside on Quarto Pub, in this case, but we could put them on a different hosting service.


## Adding text
### 

Quarto allows for a combination of plain text and R code. This same feature allows you to add plain text to your website.

### Exercise 1

Open `about.qmd `. Delete all the current text, except for the YAML header. Ensure that the `title` is `"About"`. Add `## About Me` as the first (and only) line of text. Render the QMD. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-text-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Hash signs in front of text makes the text into a header. The organization of headers is determined by the number of hash signs. Fewer hash signs make higher level headers, i.e. bigger text. More hash signs make lower level headers, i.e. smaller text. 

### 

Keep in mind that your browser now has two tabs which show your website. First, the `quartopub.com` version, which has not changed since you last hit `quarto publish`. The only way to affect the public website is to publish to it. Second, the `localhost` version, which is what you have been changing every time that you render `index.qmd`.

### Exercise 2

Write a one sentence description of yourself. Write it below the header. Include your name and school, either the one you attend or one from which you have graduated. Write until the end of the line, i.e. do not use the `Enter` key to wrap text. When you are finished, render the QMD. Example:

````
My name is David Kane, and I graduated from Williams College.
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You can have a Quarto document without a YAML header, if you like. You can also have an empty YAML header. But, it will often be the case that we want all the files in a project to have similar YAML headers in order to create a consistent look-and-feel.


### Exercise 3

Let's bold your name and italicize your school's name. In the description you have already written, surround your name with two asterisks, `**`, on both sides. Let's also put a single asterisk, `*`, around both sides of your school. Example:

````
My name is **David Kane**, and I graduated from *Williams College*.
````

`Command/Ctrl + Shift + K`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### 

Quarto, which is based on the Markdown language, has a variety of [formatting options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

Examples of Quarto formatting options incclude:

````
**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}
````

<!-- Can we make the format of the above look like the below? Like put them both in boxes? Right now, only the raw text is in a box, because of the four backticks. -->

These look like:

**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}


### Exercise 4

At the bottom of `about.qmd`, let's create text which is also a hyperlink to a website. Enclose the text "Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp" in brackets `[]`. Then, without a space intervening, add parentheses `()` which enclose a link to the relevant website: `https://bootcamp.davidkane.info`.

It should look like:

````
[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info)
````

`Command/Ctrl + Shift + K`. (Recall that rendering automatically saves the file first.)

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd", pattern = "Kane")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-text-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

You only need a few [formatting tricks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for working with Quarto files, but you will use those tricks repeatedly.


### Exercise 5

Push all the changes to Git, and issue the `quarto publish` command in the Terminal. You need to hit "Enter" at least once. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Troubleshooting Quarto documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks. Additionally, the error could be due to issues with the Quarto document itself or due to the R code in the Quarto document.

If the errors are due to the R code in the document, the first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session. Render the QMD. If youâ€™re lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out whatâ€™s going on interactively.

## Adding new pages
### 

Here you will learn how to create new pages for your website, accessible via the navigation bar at the top.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> Quarto Document...`. Title it "Sources". Select "Create Empty Document" (in the bottom left corner). Save the file, changing the file name from `Untitled.qmd` to `sources.qmd`. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `ls *qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You should see `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, and `sources.qmd` in the output. If not, make sure you are in the `first-website` directory. The `*qmd` regular expression selects only files with names which end with the letters `qmd`.

### Exercise 2

In the `sources.qmd` file, below the YAML header, add the text `An overview of sources used in my project.` Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("sources.qmd", pattern = "overview")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-new-pages-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Note how newly created Quarto documents like `sources.qmd` differ from that we have previously created in two ways. First, they do not have a `format: html` YAML line in the header. Second, they feature different default text. 

This is an RStudio feature. It knows that this directory is a website project and that, therefore, it is unnecessary to even mention the format, which is best controlled from `_quarto.yml`. 


### Exercise 3

Add the following sentence: 

````
These are my sources. Here are some challenges. Quarto websites are awesome.
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("sources.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

A website, when you first look closely, may appear overwhelming in its complexity. But it is usually created from of a simple collection of text files, each of them quite simple.

You may be directed to the `localhost` version of your website, showing the "Sources" page. You have rendered the QMD into HTML. But notice that there is no way to get to this page via the website menu . . . 

### Exercise 4

Open the `_quarto.yml` file. You should see a line that says `navbar`. Below this line you should see the line `left`. Below this is the code that creates the header links for the navigation bar on your site. It should look like:

```
website:
  title: "A New Website, second edition"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```
    

### 

To add `sources.qmd` as a new page which will appear on the menu, we need to edit this as follows:

```
website:
  title: "A New Website, second edition"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - href: sources.qmd
        text: Sources
```

Note the two additional lines. 

The `href` line tells Quarto to create an HTML page by rendering `sources.qmd` and to include that new page in the website. 

The `text` line tells Quarto to format the link in the **nav**igation tool**bar** as `Sources`. This is the same process by which the home page, created from `index.qmd`, has a link labeled `Home`.

Since `- about.qmd` appears without either the `href` or `text` argument, Quarto assumes that you want the link to be the same as the title of the QMD. 

<!-- Is this true? Explain this better. -->

### 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 8)
```

### 

**YAML files are *very* tricky!** Tabs and white spaces matter. The code `left` before the navbar items puts the navigation bar on the left side of your site. This can be changed to `right``.


### Exercise 5

Run `quarto preview` from the Terminal. You will need to hit "Enter" once. Check out your new project! See how "Sources" now appears on the navigation toolbar. Click on "Sources" and see how the text you added to `sources.qmd` now appears on the web.

Run `ls _site/*html` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You should see several HTML pages, including `sources.html`. Quarto websites, like many similar frameworks, place all the pages which appear on the web into a single directory, like `_site`, and then move that directory onto a hosting service like Quarto Pub.


### Exercise 6

In the `_quarto.yml` file, delete the two lines of code that create the link and header for the "Sources" page.

In the Terminal, stop the preview by hitting the stop sign button. Then, use `rm` to remove `sources.qmd`. Run `ls *qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

There should not be a `sources.qmd` file. We are practicing these skills to make you more comfortable building up and tearing down the parts of a project. You need to build more than one house to get good at house-building!

### Exercise 7

Make two more empty Quarto documents, in the same way as you did above, with titles `"Source 1"` and `"Source 2"`.  

You should save them both (so they're not `untitled1` and `untitled2`). Name them `source-1.qmd` and `source-2.qmd`. 

In the Terminal, run the command `head source-1.qmd source-2.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

In many Terminal commands, you can provide more than one file as the target of the command. In this case, `head` will be applied to `source-1.qmd` and then `source-2.qmd` sequentially.


### Exercise 8

Let's create a drop-down menu called "Sources" through which one could visit either the page for "Source 1" or "Source 2" from the top menu.

We will be messing around with YAML settings to make this, so pay very close attention

The Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/) provides an [excellent overview](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html) of approaches to website navigation. 

Change `_quarto.yml` so that the `navbar` section looks like this


````
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - text: Sources
        menu:
          - href: source-1.qmd
            text: Source 1
          - href: source-2.qmd
            text: Source 2 
      - about.qmd
````        

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 10)
```

### 

Run `quarto preview` to see the changes. 


### Exercise 9

Go to the Git tab, then commit and push your new changes to Github. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added source pages".

From the Terminal, run `git log -n 1`. CP/CR. 

(You will probably need to stop the preview. But, if you want to be tricky, you can start a new Terminal by clicking on the small triangle next to the Terminal triangle --- below the Terminal tab in the Console pane --- and selecting "New Terminal".)

```{r adding-new-pages-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Type `quarto publish` in the Terminal and hit "Enter." Explore the use of the "Sources" menu on your website.


## Using an RDS file
### 

An RDS file allows us to save any R object in a file. When we read from an RDS, we avoid having to run the code which created the object again. Instead, we simply have access to the object. This is very convenient for any code which takes a long time to run, such as intensive data manipulation.

Restart your R session with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. As always, this will require you to "Terminate Jobs" your tutorial.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Save the file. Name the file `process_data.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Make sure that `process_data.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to record the exact steps we used in analyzing some data or in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In `process_data.R`, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Because this is a script, you don't need to create a code chunk. Scripts are most useful for work which simply creates an object, often a new data set or a graphic. 

### Exercise 3

Skip a line after `library(tidyverse)`. Again, this is a script, so there are no code chunks, but skipping a line in between substantively different parts of the code is a good idea. Add this code:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like this:

````
library(tidyverse)

diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

You should try to learn how to work in two ways. First is interactively, trying things at the Console. Seeing what happens. Going line-by-line. Second is writtenly --- yes, I just made up this word --- adding code to your script/QMD and then executing all the code at once. 

<!-- Could explain this better, maybe illustrate some step-by-step examples. Maybe in another tutorial, like Chapter 29? -->

Of course, the best approach is to use these two methods during your analysis, depending on which is best for the next step you need to take. 

### Exercise 4

Place your cursor in `process_data.R` at `filter(z != 0) |>`. Hit `Command/Ctrl + Enter`. This will cause the pipe to be pasted to the Console and then executed there. (Note that this should generate an error.) CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The cause of the error is the distinction between the two worlds: the world of the Console and the world of the Script. The Script includes `library(tidyverse)`. So, when you source `process_data.R` in the next question, everything works fine. The Console, however, knows nothing about the `diamonds` tibble or about commands like `select()` or `filter()`. Recall that we recently restarted R. So, the **tidyverse** library, which contains `diamonds` and those commands, has not been loaded in the Console. 

A line of code, like `library(tidyverse)`, might exist in a script, but unless/until that line is executed in the Console, the Console won't know anything about it.


### Exercise 5

"Source" the entire script by pressing the "Source" button on the upper right. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````

  â„¹ 6,764 more rows
  â„¹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
> 
````

The output of the pipe is our new tibble with 6,764 rows.


### Exercise 6

Change the code so that the pipe, instead of just vomiting out its result for printing, assigns that result to a new object, named `D_diamonds`. Your script should look like:

````
library(tidyverse)

D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

Source the new script. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/first-website/process_data.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
+   filter(z != 0) |> 
+   filter(color == "D") 
>
````

Notice how different this looks from the previous output. 

First, none of the messages associated with the **tidyverse** package are displayed. R only shows these messages the first time you load the package in a session. 

Second, the rows of the tibble are not shown because the pipe no longer just vomits them out at the end. Instead, the results of the pipe are assigned to a new object: `D_diamonds`. Assignment does not result in printed output. 


### Exercise 7

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> ls()
[1] "D_diamonds"
> 
````

### 

We have created a new object in the environment called `D_diamonds`. You can also see this object if you click on the Environment tab within the Environment pane. The name `D_diamonds` is meant to remind us that all the diamonds in this tibble are of color D.


### Exercise 8

Restart your R session again. You can never restart your R session too often! The best way to do this is with the shortcut command: `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. (This is the number zero, not the letter "O.")

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> ls()
character(0)
> 
````

`D_diamonds` has disappeared! Objects in the R environment vanish once R restarts. And that is OK! We have the script, `process_data.R`, which allows us to recreate the object whenever we want.

### Exercise 9

Source `process_data.R`. From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

`D_diamonds` is back! If you type `D_diamonds` at the Console and hit "Enter," the contents of the tibble will appear.

### Exercise 10

It is often useful to save a permanent copy of an R object like a plot or a tibble. [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) from the **readr** package is the most common approach for tibbles.

From the Console, run `write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")`. This function does not produce any output. The first argument is the R object(s) which you want to save. The second argument is the name of the file which will hold that object.

From the Console, run `list.files(pattern = "clean")`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files(pattern = "clean")
[1] "clean_data.rds"
> 
````

The `pattern` argument to `list.files()` allows us to only look for files which match a regular expression.

There are now three objects associated with our tibble: 

* The script, `process_data.R`, which we used to create it. 

* The R object, `D_diamonds`, which only exists in the R session in which it was created. 

* The RDS object, `clean_data.rds`, which contains the data and which continues to exist even after the R session ends. Indeed, the RDS object can be committed and pushed to Github. (But be careful of pushing large objects (greater than 100 megabytes) to Github.)


### Exercise 11

Restart your R session with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. When R restarts, you should still be in the `first-website` project. At the Console, run `library(tidyverse)`. We need to reload the **tidyverse** every time we restart R.

At the Console, run `read_rds("clean_data.rds")`. CP/CR.


```{r using-an-rds-file-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````

````

The value returned by `read_rds()` is whatever is contained in the RDS object. In this case, that is a tibble. But, when the object at the Console is a tibble, the contents of the tibble are just printed out, as here.


### Exercise 12

Open the `process_data`.R` script. At the bottom, skip a line after the pipe and then add this line (the same one we just executed at the Console):

````
write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")
````

It is separate from, and unconnected to, the pipe which creates the `D_diamonds` tibble. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

This is a common approach to scripts which are parts of larger projects. They finish by creating an object which is then used by other code in the project.

### Exercise 13

Source `process_data.R`. The easiest way of doing so, as before, is to open the file in the Source pane and then click the "Source" button.

In the Terminal, run `ls clean*`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-13}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ ls clean*
clean_data.rds
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

`clean*` is a regular expression which matches any file which begins with the letters `clean`. 

Think about the overall workflow.

* First, we worked interactively, just playing around with plots in `index.qmd`, trying to figure out what works.

* Second, once we had a good idea of what we were doing, we moved to a script, `process_data.R`. We don't want that code to be re-run every time we update `index.qmd`. So, we move some of the work to a script, to be run interactively whenever we need to change something.

* Third, we changed the script so that its final output was a permanent object. Later parts of the process can just begin with `clean_data.rds`.


## Using a PNG file
### 

A PNG file allows us to save any R graphic in a file. When we use a PNG, we avoid having to re-run the code which created it. This is very convenient for graphics which take a long time to create.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Press save in the left of the top panel. Name the file `make_plot.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Make sure that `make_plot.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to record the exact steps we used in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some small changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In the R script, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Naming conventions are important. It is fine to have dashes in a code chunk label. However, any object which might be used from the Terminal, like the name of a script, should avoid dashes because the Terminal interprets a dash as a special character, not necessarily as part of the file name. 

### Exercise 3

Copy this code into `make_plot.R`, after skipping a line after `library(tidyverse)`.  Save the R script.

````
x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The code does two things. 

First, it reads the tibble from `clean_data.rds` and assigns that tibble to `x`. (The fact that, in our `process_data.R` script, this data was named `D_diamonds` is irrelevant. `write_rds()` just saves the tibble, not the *name* of the tibble.)

Second, it starts a new pipe with `x` and then creates our plot. Because the plot is not assigned to an object, it is just spat back out, and then shows up in the Plots tab.

<!-- DK: Does it show up in the Plot tab or the Viewer tab? Why? -->

### Exercise 4

Source the entire script by pressing the "Source" button. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/first-website/make_plot.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

> x |> 
+   ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
+     geom_point() +
+     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
+     labs(titl .... [TRUNCATED] 
> 
````

At this point, we face the same problem as we faced when working on `process_data.R`. The script creates the object, in this case a graphic, which we want. But we need a way to save a permanent copy of that object.

### Exercise 5

Edit `make_plot.R` in two ways. First, assign the plot to an object named `D_plot`. Second, insert, after the graphic pipe, `ggsave("size_v_weight.png", D_plot)`. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

### 

As with `clean_data.R`, we have created a script which encapsulates, from start-to-finish, a discrete part of our analysis. In this case, we start from the tibble saved in `clean_data.rds` and finish by saving a graphic in `size_v_weight.png`.

### Exercise 6

Source `make_plot.R`. From the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> list.files()
 [1] "_publish.yml"        "_quarto.yml"         "_site"               "about.qmd"          
 [5] "clean_data.rds"      "first-website.Rproj" "index.qmd"           "make_plot.R"        
 [9] "process_data.R"      "README.md"           "size_v_weight.png"   "sources-1.qmd"      
[13] "sources-2.qmd"       "sources.qmd"         "styles.css"         
> 
````

That is a lot of files! Note the new script `make_plot.R`, the object with which it starts, `clean_data.rds`, and the object which it creates, `size_v_weight.png`. 


### Exercise 7

Open the `index.qmd` file. In the `setup` code chunk, add `library(knitr)`. In the second code chunk, delete all the plotting code. Replace it all with `knitr::include_graphics("size_v_weight.png")`. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

<!-- DK: Very annoying that we need this hack, but if you just include this text with four backticks, R still runs the R code, generating two failures: duplicate "setup" code chunk names and non-existent PNG file.  -->

<!-- DK: Or maybe it is overkill to show what the answer looks like. Students mostly got it right anyway! -->

```{r file = "images/index-example.txt", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

There was nothing wrong, *per se* with having the plotting code in `index.qmd` rather than `make_plot.R`. The problem arises when that plotting code takes a long time to run, as it often will. We don't want to re-run all the code each time we make a small change to the website. It is much better to separate out the plotting code and only run it when we need to.

### Exercise 8

From the Terminal, run `quarto publish`. You will need to hit "Enter" at least once. CP/CR.


```{r using-a-png-file-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````

````

Note the workflow. At the start, we created a pipe in `index.qmd` which does everything and then, later, we moved the code into separate scripts so that we don't need to run all the analysis each time we render the website. This is a very common approach. First, get something working. Second, organize and clean it all up. 

In a complex project, we will often create directories --- like `code`, `data`, and `images` --- into which we will place files like `process_data.R`, `clean_data.rds`, and `size_v_weight.png`, respectively.

### Exercise 9

Look up the help page for `theme_minimal()` by running `?theme_minimal` at the Console. Copy-and-paste the Description.

```{r using-a-png-file-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Graphics on the web often appear differently than graphics on your computer, so [many people find it useful](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures) to increase the size of the text in their graphics. [A simple way](https://minimaxir.com/2017/08/ggplot2-web/) to do that is to add `theme_minimal(base_size = 18)` to your plot creation code. Fortunately, doing so is as simple as editing and then re-running `make_plot.R`.

### Exercise 10

Look up the help page for `ggsave()`. Copy-and-paste the Description.

```{r using-a-png-file-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

When saving graphics for web display, it is often useful to specify their exact size with a command like `ggsave("your-file.png", your-plot, width = 4, height = 3)`. An earlier edition of [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org/) also [notes](https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/saving) that:

> For raster graphics (i.e. .png, .jpg), the dpi argument controls the resolution of the plot. It defaults to 300, which is appropriate for most printers, but you may want to use 600 for particularly high-resolution output, or 96 for on-screen (e.g., web) display.
